Regarding Inheritance

In OOP, we often organize classes in hierarchy to avoid duplication and reduce redundancy. The classes in the lower hierarchy inherit all the variable(attributes) and methods(dynamic behaviour) from the higher hierarchies.

A class in the lower hierarchy is called a subclass (or derived ,child,extended class). A class in the upper hierarchy is called a super (or base ,parent class).

By pulling out all the common variables and methods into the superclasses, and leave the specialized varaibles and methods in the subclass, redundancy can be greatly reduced or eliminated as these common variables and methods do not need to be repeated in all the subclass. Re usability is maximum

A subclass inherits all the member variables and methods from its superclasses(the immediate parent and all its ancestors).It can use the inherited methods and variables as they are. It may also override an inherited mthod by providing its own version, rohide an inherited variable by defining a variable of the same name.

Summary:Sub class IS-A super class, and something more (additionnal state + additional methods and something modified (behavious -- method overrding))

eg : Person ,Student,Faculty
Emp,Manager,SalesManager,Worker,TempWorker,HRManager


        Person                                Emp
           |                                   | 
    |           |                       |           |
Student     Faculty                 Manager       Worker
                                |           |       |
                            SaleMrg       HrMGR     TempWorker

A subclass inherits all the variables and methods from its superclasses,includeing its immediate parent as well as all the ancestors.

It is important to note that a subclass is not a "subset" of superclasses.In contrast, subclass is a "superset" of a superclas.It is because a subclass inherits all the variable and methods of the superclass, in addition, it extends the superclass by providing more variables and methods.

Types of Inheritance
1.single Inheritance
class A{} class B extends A{} //suported by java

2.Multi level Inheritance
class A{} class B extends A{} class C extended B{} //suported by java

3.Mulitple Inheritance ----Not Supported
Class A{} extends B,C{} ------Compiler error

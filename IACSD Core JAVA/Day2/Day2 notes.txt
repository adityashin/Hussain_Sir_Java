Java data types : which of 2 categories
    |                       |
primitive             reference types
(value holding)         (address holding)


Types of conversion in primitive data types
1. Widening (auto conversion/promotion):performed by javac
eg : byte > int, short > double, long > float
(small size converted automatically to big byte size by JVM)

2. Narrowing conversion : performed by prog(using type casting)
eg:double > float , int > byte 
(It's OK that am losing data on the above conversion)

(Maximum size will be always dominating)
What will data type of result of
byte * byte = int
byte * short = int
short * short = int
int * long = long
long * float = float
float * double = double
byte / short / int / float * double  = double

this--keyword in java
"this" represents => current object reference
Usages
1.TO un-hide instance variable from local variable
eg:this.width = width

2.To invoke constructor of the same class from different constructor.
eg: this(side,side,side);

Interface in java

What is Interface?

An Interface in java is a blueprint of a class.It has public static final data member and public an abstract metods only.

The interface in java is a mechanism to achieve fully abstraction. Ther can be only abstract methods in the java interface(not method body)(true till JDK1.7).It is used to achieve full abstraction and multiple inheritance in java

***Java Interface also represents IS-A relationship.

It cannot be instantiated just like abstract class.


****By default the Interface data members are "public static final";   <------cannot be change once declared
****whenever you declare any method in interface java CLR will implicitly add "public abstract " to the method.


Why java interfaces?    
1.It is used to achieve full abstraction.
2.By interface, we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
3.IT can be used to achieve loose coupling.
()

The java compiler adds public and abstract keyword before the interface method and public, static and final keywords before data members.

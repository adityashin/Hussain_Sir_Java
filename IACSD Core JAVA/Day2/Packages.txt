About Packages
1. Creation: package statement has to placed as the 1st statement in java source.
eg. package p1; => the classes will be part of package p1.

2.Pakcage names are mapped to folder names.
eg:package p1:class A{......}

3.For simplicity ---create folder p1 ---under <src> & compiler from</src>
From <src></src>
javac -d .\bin p1\A.java

-> javac will auto create the sub-folder <bin> folder and place A class within <bin>
